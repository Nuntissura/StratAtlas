## Scope

Concrete extraction of requirement and primitive obligations this WP must satisfy before status promotion.

## Reality Boundary Snapshot

- Allowed Temporary Fallbacks: TBD
- Promotion Guard: RESEARCH and SCAFFOLD packets do not promote linked requirements or primitives to E2E-VERIFIED.

## Change Ledger Snapshot

- What Became Real: TBD
- What Remains Simulated: TBD
- Next Blocking Real Seam: TBD
