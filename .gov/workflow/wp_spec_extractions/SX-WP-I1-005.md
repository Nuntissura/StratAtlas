Iteration: I1

## Scope

Concrete extraction of requirement and primitive obligations this WP must satisfy before status promotion.

## Reality Boundary Snapshot

- Real Seam: The actual app shell changes so the map is visually dominant and workflow detail is partitioned into calmer tabs, panes, and trays.
- User-Visible Win: Users can understand where to act next without the current all-at-once dashboard overload.
- Proof Target: Verified region selectors remain intact, the map stays center stage, grouped workflows render behind intentional tabs, and tests/smoke prove the shell still supports required map-linked flows.
- Allowed Temporary Fallbacks: Existing cards and forms may remain, but only if they are rehoused behind task-grouped tabs or tray panels rather than all shown at once.
- Promotion Guard: No new mocked or decorative shell surfaces; completion requires a real product shell change, not only CSS repainting.

## Change Ledger Snapshot

- What Became Real: The restyle packet now has an explicit shell boundary, proof target, and governing rubric.
- What Remains Simulated: No new simulation is introduced; the current shell still exists until product changes land.
- Next Blocking Real Seam: Move the real app shell from dashboard composition to a task-grouped workbench without breaking verified runtime behavior.

## Requirement Extraction

| Requirement | Level | Section | Description | Target | Status |
|-------------|-------|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| REQ-0011 | MUST | Section 11.4 | Every layer/chart/annotation/export labeled as Observed Evidence, Curated Context, Modeled Output, or AI-Derived Interpretation | All | E2E-VERIFIED |
| REQ-0012 | MUST | Section 11.4 | Modeled outputs MUST include uncertainty representation and MUST NOT be presented as observed | All | E2E-VERIFIED |
| REQ-0200 | MUST | Section 11.1 | UI stable regions: header, left panel, right panel, bottom panel, main canvas | I1 | E2E-VERIFIED |
| REQ-0201 | MUST | Section 11.2 | UI modes: Live/Recent, Replay, Compare, Scenario, Collaboration, Offline | I1 | E2E-VERIFIED |
| REQ-0211 | MUST | Section 11.5 | Graceful degradation via aggregation when budget cannot be met; UI indicates aggregation | I1 | E2E-VERIFIED |
